# FAQ

1. **Does the CalcNote support the percentage calculations?**  
Unfortunately, crrent version of CalcNote does not support the percentage calculations. I will implement it in the future. e.g. `1000 + 10% = 1100`
2. **Cannot access the settings screen when I hid the action bar.**  
You can access the settings screen via side menu. You can show the side menu to swipe from the left side to the right side or tap the hardware menu key.
3. **The height of keypad is too small.**  
The height of keypad is adjusted to the same as the height of software keyboad. You can adjust height of keypad by the [Keypad Settings](settings.md).
