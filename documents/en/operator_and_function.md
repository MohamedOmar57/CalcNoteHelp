## Subtotals
You can calculate subtotals using `Subtotal` keyword.
`Subtotal` only calculates up to the last `Subtotal`.Subtotal results are not included in the total.


```java
Drink
120 * 6    /*=720*/
250 * 6    /*=1500*/
Subtotal   /*=2220*/

Food
480 * 2    /*=960*/
235 * 1    /*=235*/
890 * 2    /*=1780*/
Subtotal   /*=2975*/
Total      /*=5195*/
```
